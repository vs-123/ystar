~=~=~=~=~=~=

   A custom xorshift64* implementation in C, with my own constants.

   This project reuses my xorshift* repo @ https://github.com/vs-123/xorshift-star

|| INSTALLATION ||
~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

   Clone the repository:
      % git clone https://github.com/vs-123/ystar

   Generate the amalgamated single-header file using the Python script: (optional)
      % python3 ./amalgamate.py
      [DONE] 'ystar.h' DISTRIBUTABLE HEADER GENERATED

   The single-header file will be generated in dist/, include dist/
   in your project to start using it.

   [NOTE]
      While I aim to keep dist/mylib.h updated with every commit,
      there's always a chance that it may lag behind the latest changes in =src/= or =include/=.
      In order to ensure you have the absolute latest version,
      it is recommended to run the =amalgamate.py= Python script manually.
