~=~=~=~=~=~=

   A custom xorshift64* implementation in C, with my own constants.

   This project reuses my xorshift* repo @ https://github.com/vs-123/xorshift-star

~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=
|| INSTALLATION ||
~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

   Clone the repository:
      % git clone https://github.com/vs-123/ystar

   Generate the amalgamated single-header file using the Python script: (optional)
      % python3 ./amalgamate.py
      [DONE] 'ystar.h' DISTRIBUTABLE HEADER GENERATED

   The single-header file will be generated in dist/, include dist/
   in your project to start using it.

   [NOTE]
      While I aim to keep dist/mylib.h updated with every commit,
      there's always a chance that it may lag behind the latest changes in =src/= or =include/=.
      In order to ensure you have the absolute latest version,
      it is recommended to run the =amalgamate.py= Python script manually.

|| USAGE ||
~=~=~=~=~=~

   Once you've completed the installation, you may use the library as follows:
   
      o   In any one file (for e.g. =main.c=), define =YSTAR_IMPLEMENTATION= before including the header:
      
             #define YSTAR_IMPLEMENTATION
	     #include "ystar.h"

	     /* now you can use ystar! */

             uint64_t seed = 5;
             uint32_t num = ystar_between (&seed, 1, 10);
	     
      o   In any other file where you want to use the library functions, just include the header normally
          without the define:

             #include "ystar.h"

             void some_other_function() {
                uint64_t seed = 10;
                uint32_t num = ystar_between (&seed, 1, 25);
             }
